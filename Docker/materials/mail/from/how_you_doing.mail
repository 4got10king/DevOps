Hey! How's it going? Did you make it to England? How did you like being in the middle of the ocean?

I recently found a colleague who helped me with some monitoring tasks. Looks a lot like you! He is also always eager to learn new things and help others.

Well, I'm also still learning SSH to get to the stuff we've been discussing, but it's hard to do it alone xD.

Call me when you have something to tell me about the new job too?
